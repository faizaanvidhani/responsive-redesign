        Responsive Redesign
      </h1>
      <p>
        To practice the workflow of redesigning websites, I decided to transform a website
        that needed improvement. I chose a website belonging to a local Chinese restaurant near
        where I live. The existing interface had flaws that needed to be addressed. To address the issues
        of the existing interface, I created both lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototypes and built a 
        responsive website based on these prototypes. For the final product, click <a class="black-link" href="https://faizaanvidhani.github.io/chinese-restaurant-redesign/">here.</a>

        I chose this custom-made restaurant ordering site since I saw many opportunities for improvement in visual design (e.g. better use of white space, headings of different weights/levels, more intuitive layout).

        <h3>Usability Analysis</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Learnability</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First-time users may have a hard time learning about the restaurant due to the bulky body of text in the “Welcome” section, which makes it harder to extract relevant information 
              </li>
              <li>
                First-time users may have a hard time finding the link to the customer reviews since the link is placed within a body of text
              </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Memorability</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The menu option is located in a logical place since it is an element in the navigation bar. Thus, it is easy for casual users to recall where to look to place an order 
            </li>
            <li>
              However, casual users may find it difficult to recall where the telephone number is located since all the relevant information seems to be stored in the bulky body of text in the ‘Welcome’ section
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Efficiency</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Order online” could be turned from bolded text to a button that transports users to the menu page to make ordering easier and more efficient
            </li>
            <li>
              The address and contact information are related pieces of information that should be situated near each other. Currently, the contact information is located at the top-left corner; the address is located in the middle of the screen. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3>Accessibility Findings</h3>
        <p>
          While the WebAIM Wave accessibility tool was unable to render my page correctly, 
          I was still able to leverage the tool to find possible accessibility problems. I agreed with most of the 
          problems pointed out by the tool.  For example, one problem raised was that, many of the images lacked 
          alternative text. The lack of alternative text is alarming — it affects users of the site who are visually 
          impaired. These users rely on screen readers that process alternative text to communicate the contents of the site. 
          Also, the tool warned that there was low contrast between the text and background colors. While the text seemed 
          readable to me, it may be that other users may have a hard time reading the text.

      <h3>
        Low-Fidelity Wireframing
      </h3>
      <p>
        To address the usability issues, I created low-fidelity wireframes for desktop,
        tablet, and mobile sizes. I have annotated the desktop prototype with the intent
        of some of my design choices. These annotations also apply to the other low-fidelity
        wireframes.

          Visual Design Style Guide

        <p>
          Next, I created a visual design style guide to thoroughly describe the different
          base states, interaction states, and other visual elements used on the actual website.

          After creating a visual design style guide, I created high-fidelity prototypes. I used
          visual design principles such as color, alignment, and font differences to show visual hierarchy
          in the interface.

        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
        By analyzing a simple website, I was able to identify several usability flaws. I found that
        it was incredibly helpful to fragment the redesigning process into separate steps: identification of
        flaws, lo-fi prototyping, hi-fi prototyping, and redesigning the actual site. I realized the challenges
        of making a website that caters to first-time, casual, and frequent users. But more importantly, I realized
        how using a systematic process can help overcome these challenges in building a great interface.
